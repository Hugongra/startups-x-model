# Startups Success Prediction Project

The primary goal of this project is to predict the success of startups transitioning from the early stages of ideation and inception to the scale-up stage by analyzing their Twitter activity.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Project Startups 2.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code, analysis, and results for the entire project.
- `Startups Project Data Mining.pdf`: The comprehensive report generated from the analysis in pdf format
- `startup_traction (2).csv`: The dataset which contains startup traction data used for this analysis.
- `README.md`: This file.

## DataSources

- Startup Traction data provided in CSV format:

  - [startup_traction (2).csv](<https://github.com/Hugongra/startups-x-model/blob/main/startup_traction%20(2).csv>)

## Analysis and Results

**The comprehensive report generated from the analysis**

[Project Startups 2.ipynb](https://github.com/Hugongra/startups-x-model/blob/main/Project%20Startups%202.ipynb)

This project focuses on several key areas of analysis which include:

**Data Quality**: Identifying and correcting manual errors found in the dataset.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Evaluation of data distributions, relationships, and their key statistics.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developing of models in order to predict future performance and key metrics.
- **Visualization**: Creation of charts and graphs to illustrate discoveries and trends.
